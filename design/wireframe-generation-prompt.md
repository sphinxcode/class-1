## Prompt:

Create 3 distinct UX wireframe variations for a coding education web app designed for children ages 8-14. Each wireframe should show the main learning interface with the following requirements:

**Core Layout:**
- Split-screen interface: video player on the left (40% width), interactive code editor on the right (60% width)
- Top navigation bar with: logo, course progress indicator, user profile icon
- Bottom controls: "Previous Lesson" and "Next Lesson" buttons, "Run Code" button

**Essential UI Elements:**
- Video player with play/pause, progress bar, speed controls, and closed captions toggle
- Code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a "Reset Code" button
- Console/output panel below the code editor showing code execution results
- Sidebar with collapsible course outline (list of lessons with checkmarks for completed ones)

**Design Variations (create 3 different approaches):**

**Wireframe 1 - Playful & Gamified:**
- Bright, rounded corners and playful shapes
- Progress bar designed like a game level progression (with stars or badges)
- Fun, kid-friendly icons and illustrations
- Card-based layout for lesson list
- Confetti or celebration animation triggers on lesson completion (show in wireframe state)

**Wireframe 2 - Clean & Minimal:**
- Professional, spacious design with plenty of white space
- Flat, modern aesthetic with subtle shadows
- Simple, clear typography hierarchy
- Tab-based navigation for switching between lessons
- Focus mode toggle to hide distractions

**Wireframe 3 - Dark Mode & Immersive:**
- Dark background with vibrant accent colors
- Code editor styled like professional IDEs (VS Code-inspired)
- Neon or glowing highlights for interactive elements
- Split-screen with resizable panels (show drag handle in the middle)
- Achievement panel showing coding streaks and completed projects

**Technical Specifications:**
- Desktop/tablet view (1920x1080 reference resolution)
- Show responsive breakpoints or mobile adaptation considerations
- Label all interactive elements clearly
- Include hover states or interaction hints where relevant
- Use placeholder content: video thumbnail, sample JavaScript code in the editor, example console output

**Style Notes:**
- Make wireframes detailed enough to show component hierarchy
- Use grayscale with one accent color to highlight primary actions
- Include annotations for key interactions or features
- Design should feel modern, engaging, and age-appropriate (not childish, but approachable)

Deliver all 3 wireframes in a comparison layout so I can evaluate them side by side.
