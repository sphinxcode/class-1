## 5. Input VAT and Output VAT Mechanics

### Basic Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

### Calculation Formulas

**If purchase is VAT-exclusive:**
```
Input VAT = Purchase Amount x 12%
```

**If purchase is VAT-inclusive:**
```
Input VAT = Purchase Amount x (12/112)
```

**VAT Payable:**
```
VAT Payable = Output VAT - Input VAT
```

### Government Sales - Withholding VAT

Government agencies, including GOCCs, must withhold **5% final VAT** on purchases before payment.
