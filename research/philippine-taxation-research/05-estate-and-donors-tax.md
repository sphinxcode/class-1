# Philippine Estate and Donor's Tax Laws

## Executive Summary

This report covers the current provisions under Republic Act No. 10963 (TRAIN Law), effective January 1, 2018, which significantly reformed estate and donor's taxation in the Philippines by introducing simplified flat tax rates and increased deductions.

---

## 1. Estate Tax Rate (Flat Rate under TRAIN Law)

### Current Rate Structure
- **Flat Rate: 6%** on the value of the net estate
- Applies to net estate exceeding **PHP 5,000,000** (due to the standard deduction)
- Effective: January 1, 2018

### Previous Rate Structure (Pre-TRAIN)
The old system had a graduated six-bracket schedule with rates ranging from **5% to 20%** based on estate value.

### Key Point
The net estate is computed as: **Gross Estate minus Allowable Deductions = Net Taxable Estate**

- Filing is still required if gross estate exceeds PHP 200,000

### Practical Tax-Free Estate
Due to the PHP 5,000,000 standard deduction and PHP 10,000,000 family home exemption:
- **Effective tax-free threshold: Up to PHP 15,000,000** for estates consisting primarily of the family home

## 4. Donor's Tax Rate Structure

### Current Rate (Under TRAIN Law)
- **Flat Rate: 6%** on total net gifts exceeding **PHP 250,000** per calendar year
- No distinction between donations to relatives vs. strangers

### Tax Computation
| Net Gifts During Calendar Year | Donor's Tax |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| PHP 250,000 and below | **Exempt** |
| Over PHP 250,000 | **6% on excess over PHP 250,000** |

### Example Computation
If a donor gives PHP 1,000,000 in a calendar year:
- Taxable amount: PHP 1,000,000 - PHP 250,000 = PHP 750,000
- Donor's tax: PHP 750,000 x 6% = **PHP 45,000**
